    "International and within-country migration trends are contributing to a constantly growing demand for housing in big developed cities. The growing demand is driving the prices of properties up, creating an __ongoing housing problem, especially in major cities__. \n",
    "\n",
    "### There are multiple reasons for this and some of the key ones are:\n",
    "- Growing global population\n",
    "- Urban migration within countries\n",
    "- New international businesses attracting global talent and creating a sudden surge in demand\n",
    "- International investors and private buyers purchasing property and holding it off the market, creating shortages in supply as demand is rising\n",

    "### The cities\n",
    "I lived in Seattle, WA for a year and now I am based in Wellington, New Zealand. I see multiple parallels within the two cities located on two oposite ends of the Pacific Ocean:\n",
    "- both have relatively small size (less than 1 mln) compared to global megacities with multimilion population\n",
    "- both have a relatively compact CBD with most of the population living in various residential areas and suburbs\n",
    "- both have large Asian communities, increasingly investing in buying property in recent years\n",
    "- both have an increasingly serious problem with housing prices and availability\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal \n",
    "__I want to cluster neighbourhoods by rental price and compare the trends across the two cities by using available official data. Then based on rental price comparisons for the cost of living (and renting out property) I would consider the market supply of existing coffee businesses and their type: big chains, small local businesses,etc.__.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I want to create a small business in one of the two cities, I would be interested in multiple things, including rental prices. I also have an idea about a second part of the project focusing on coffee businesses which will use the Foursquare API.\n"
